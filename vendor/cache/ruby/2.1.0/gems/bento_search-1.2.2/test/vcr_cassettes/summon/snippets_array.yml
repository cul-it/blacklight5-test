        intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn''t betray
        it I''d be ashamed of myself.\"\" This declaration by Noam Chomsky exemplifies
        the uncompromising radicalism that has long defined his life and work. A linguist,
        philosopher, prolific author, and political activist, Chomsky is one of the
        most influential Western intellectuals of the last half-century. Yet it is
        this very capaciousness that biographers and interpreters have struggled with,
        and as a result, there are very few readable accounts of Chomsky and his project.
        Wolfgang B. Sperlich surmounts this challenge with his succinct yet in-depth
        introduction to the thinker in Noam Chomsky, one of the new titles in the
        acclaimed Critical Lives series. Beginning with Chomsky''s formative years
        as a sixteen-year-old student at the University of Pennsylvania, Sperlich
        traces his education in linguistics and politics in its rich historical context.
        He explores Chomsky''s main intellectual influences, particularly in language
        studies, and charts his strained relationship with mainstream American academia.
        Sperlich also offers an informed overview of Chomsky''s landmark linguistic
        contributions as a comprehensive introduction to his work, and he explains
        the latest developments in Chomskyan linguistics and how they influence research
        in fields as varied as neuroscience, biology, and evolution. Sperlich is equally
        attentive to Chomsky''s political activism: through Sperlich''s account we
        follow Chomsky from his pacifist-anarchist lectures and writings of the 1950s
        and 1960s to his seminal 1988 treatise, Manufacturing Consent, and his relentless
        criticism of the American government over two decades. A compact and rich
        biographical study, Noam Chomsky is a brilliant introduction to one of the
        most polarizing intellectuals of our time, a thinker whose words continue
        to pierce the heart of public discourse.","Noam Chomsky has become the acknowledged
        supreme anti-authoritarian figure of our age. A prolific writer, researcher
        and critical thinker, he has shaped contemporary linguistics, philosophy and
        liberal thought like no other. Volumes on Chomsky abound, yet an approachable
        and up-to-date introduction to the man and his life has until now been lacking,
        due perhaps to the sometimes dense and technical nature of Chomsky''s writing,
        and also the sheer volume of his work. \"Noam Chomsky\" presents just such
        an introduction. With extensive biographical background notes, photographs,
        and illustrations, Wolfgang B. Sperlich introduces the reader to Chomsky''s
        major innovations in linguistics and politics, illuminating the work within
        its historical context. Chomsky''s formative years and his main intellectual
        influences, especially in the field of language studies; and his gradual separation
        from the mainstream American intellectual community are described. The work
        also traces the latest developments in Chomskyan linguistics and how they
        relate to wider issues of cognition, neuro-science, biology and evolution.
        Chomsky''s career as a political activist is charted: from a 16-year-old university
        student against the background of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the 1950s and ''60s
        and his pacifist-anarchist lectures and writings; the 1970s and ''80s and
        his development of increasingly radical anarcho-syndicalist thought; the late
        1980s and ''90s and his seminal treatise on mass-media Manufacturing Consent;
        and, to the present where he has become an increasingly ferocious critic of
        American politics and the American political system. Those interested in Chomsky''s
        contributions to linguistics will find in Noam Chomsky a challenging but non-technical
        introduction; those interested in Chomsky''s politics will receive a common-sense
        lesson in political analysis; and, those interested in Chomsky''s life will
        discover a rich and sympathetic portrait of a man who, despite a forbidding
        reputation, is actually very human indeed."],"LCCallNum": ["P85.C47"],"SourceType":
