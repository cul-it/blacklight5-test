        highly hydrated &#x3B1;-cyclodextrin/1-undecanol inclusion complex: crystal
        structure and hydrogen-bond network from high-resolution neutron diffraction
        at 20&#x2005;K</title>\r\n<link>http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?eb5023</link>\r\n<description>The
        monoclinic C2 crystal structure of an &#x3B1;-cyclodextrin/1-undecanol host&#x2013;guest
        inclusion complex was solved using single-crystal neutron diffraction. Large
        high-quality crystals were specially produced by optimizing temperature-controlled
        growth conditions. The hydrate crystallizes in a channel-type structure formed
        by head-to-head dimer units of &#x3B1;-cyclodextrin molecules stacked like
        coins in a roll. The alkyl chain of the guest lipid is entirely embedded inside
        the tubular cavity delimited by the &#x3B1;-cyclodextrin dimer and adopts
        an all-trans planar zigzag conformation, while the alcohol polar head group
        is outside close to the &#x3B1;-cyclodextrin primary hydroxyl groups. The
        cyclodextrin dimer forms columns, which adopt a quasi-square arrangement much
        less compact than the quasi-hexagonal close packing already observed in the
        less hydrated &#x3B1;-cyclodextrin channel-type structures usually found with
        similar linear guests. The lack of compactness of this crystal form is related
        to the high number of interstitial water molecules. The replacement of 1-undecanol
        by 1-decanol does not modify the overall crystal structure of the hydrate
        as shown by additional X-ray diffraction investigations comparing the two
        host&#x2013;guest assemblies. This is the first study that analyses the entire

        topological analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) of a molecule
        of hexamethyldisiloxane, (H3C)3&#x2013;Si&#x2013;O&#x2013;Si&#x2013;(CH3)3,
        has been carried out, drawing a consistent picture of Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si
        bonding both in the linear and angular geometries. The ELF analysis confirms
        the idea that the O atom, in the linear geometry of (H3C)3&#x2014;Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si&#x2014;(CH3)3,
        is isolobal with the isoelectronic &#x2014;CH_3^+&#x2014; and &#x2014;BH3&#x2014;
        groups, the bonding in the Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si group being described as
        a two-electron, three-center (2e, 3c) bond. At the same time, the three oxygen
        lone pairs mirror the three C&#x2014;H and B&#x2014;H bonds, respectively.
        On the contrary, in the angular geometry the same O atoms form two Si&#x2014;O
        bonds and its lone pairs mimic the geometry of the &#x2014;CH2&#x2014; group.
        In this model the O atoms would play the same role as the formally present
        O2&#x2212; anions in the `so-called' ionic solids, such as in the skeletons
        of aluminate and silicate polyanions, thereby connecting molecular and solid-state
        chemistry as formulated by the `fragment formalism' or the `molecular unit-cell
        approach'. This unifying concept as well as the calculations we have carried
        out fully agree and also give support to earlier ideas developed by Bragg
        and Bent, among other authors. Bonding in the series of compounds P4, P4O6,
        P4O10, N4(CH2)6 (hexamethylenetetramine) and (CH)4(CH2)6 (adamantane) is discussed

        After isothermal heating at 1273&#x2005;K for around 28&#x2005;h, a single-phase
        &#x3B1;-cordierite (high-temperature hexagonal polymorph) was synthesized.
        All materials were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction and field-emission
        scanning electron microscopy. The crystal structure and microstructure were
        determined from X-ray diffraction patterns. Rietveld refinement confirmed
        the formation of magnesium&#x2013;cobalt cordierite solid solutions. The unit-cell
        volume increased with the increase of cobalt content in the starting glass.
        The crystalline microstructure of the cordierites was interpreted using a
        mathematical model of a polycrystalline material and characterized by prevalent
        crystallite shape, volume-weighted crystallite size distribution and second-order
        crystalline lattice-strain distribution. Hexagonal prismatic was the prevalent
        shape of &#x3B1;-cordierite crystallites. Bimodality in the size distribution
        was observed and interpreted as a consequence of two paths of the crystallization:
        the nucleation from glass of &#x3BC;-cordierite, which transformed into &#x3B1;-cordierite
        with annealing, or the nucleation of &#x3B1;-cordierite directly from glass
        at high temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy images agreed well with
        crystalline microstructure characteristics determined from the X-ray diffraction
        line-profile analysis.</description>\r\n<dc:identifier>DOI 10.1107/S0108768113001407</dc:identifier>\r\n<dc:creator>Serrano</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>F.J.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Montoya,

        of nominal compositions (Mg1&#x2212;xCox)2Al4Si5O18 (with x = 0, 0.2, 0.4,
        0.6, 0.8 and 1), were prepared by melting colloidal gel precursors. After
        isothermal heating at 1273&#x2005;K for around 28&#x2005;h, a single-phase
        &#x3B1;-cordierite (high-temperature hexagonal polymorph) was synthesized.
        All materials were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction and field-emission
        scanning electron microscopy. The crystal structure and microstructure were
        determined from X-ray diffraction patterns. Rietveld refinement confirmed
        the formation of magnesium&#x2013;cobalt cordierite solid solutions. The unit-cell
        volume increased with the increase of cobalt content in the starting glass.
        The crystalline microstructure of the cordierites was interpreted using a
        mathematical model of a polycrystalline material and characterized by prevalent
        crystallite shape, volume-weighted crystallite size distribution and second-order
        crystalline lattice-strain distribution. Hexagonal prismatic was the prevalent
        shape of &#x3B1;-cordierite crystallites. Bimodality in the size distribution
        was observed and interpreted as a consequence of two paths of the crystallization:
        the nucleation from glass of &#x3BC;-cordierite, which transformed into &#x3B1;-cordierite
        with annealing, or the nucleation of &#x3B1;-cordierite directly from glass
        at high temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy images agreed well with
        crystalline microstructure characteristics determined from the X-ray diffraction
        line-profile analysis.</p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0108768113002826\">\n<title>Monophosphate

        or substituting another native ion, were downloaded from the Protein Data

        in comparison with previously reported target distances, CSD data and EXAFS
        data. The set of amino acids involved in CoII binding is similar to that observed
        for catalytic ZnII sites, i.e. with a large fraction of carboxylate O atoms

        Small corrections are suggested for the target bond lengths to the aromatic
        N atoms of histidines and the O atoms of water and hydroxide. The available
        target distance for cysteine (Scys) is confirmed; those for backbone O and
        other donors remain uncertain and should be handled with caution in refinement

        the computed valences leads to extrapolated valence values close to the formal
        valence of Ti4+ for sites fully occupied by Ti, and of Fe3+ for sites fully
